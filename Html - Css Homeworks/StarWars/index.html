                When Winter is coming. When

                break down the Wall and JAVA
                 can no longer stop them ...</p>

                untyped data and components, he
                does not give up technical tasks
                "to do nicely" and is not afraid
                of calculations on the user side.
                But he comes not alone, having
                3 of his faithful friends with
                him: jQuery, React.js and Node.js.</p>
